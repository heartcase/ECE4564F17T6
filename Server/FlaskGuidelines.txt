	Go to the swaggerUI folder
	Run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" for the first time
	Then Run "python3 -m swagger_server"
	Then go to http://localhost:8080/ui/ and you will see a api document page
	You can test the API by clicking "Try it out!"
	Fill all the parameters and Click "Send"
	If you need basic auth, click the red exclamation sign to login
	Then It will show all the information of the request and response
